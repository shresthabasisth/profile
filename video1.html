<p> <h1>
This is Mopsy. She is a three year old Indie Dog. She is very shy and timid in nature but once she feels comfortable she turns into a playful kid. She loves eating but more than that she loves chasing flies and insects during food time. I got her when she was 6 months old. She has a twin named Flox and both of them are very attached to one another </p></h1>
